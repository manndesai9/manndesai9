Hi! This is my GitHub profile. I started using GitHub because I want to learn coding better and show what I can do. For me, GitHub is a place where I keep all my projects and ideas.

I like to try new things, build small apps, and learn from others. Sometimes I make mistakes, but that's how I grow. I believe sharing my work here helps me get better and also connect with people who like coding.

Right now, I am focusing on improving my skills step by step. I want to become a better programmer and maybe one day work on big projects that help others.

Thanks for visiting my profile. Feel free to check my projects and maybe give me feedback. I am always ready to learn.
